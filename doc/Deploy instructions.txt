Deplyoment of Lab Loader Interface to OCPROD (Production)


The Lab Loader Interface (LLI) deployment consists of both an Oracle Forms web
configuration and Oralce RDBMS alterations.

General:
1) Copy all files of the deployment to a single location.  This location will also be 
   used when applying the Database changes.



Web Deployment:

At the NCICB, we have created a directory on the Middle Tier Web Server 
(the same machine where RDC and OPA are deplyed) that holds C3D Utilities and Applications.
This directory is name "ncioraapps" (i.e. D:\ncioraapps).  A subdirectory "html" was also 
created, to hold Utility specific launch web pages. (i.e. D:\ncioraapps\html).

Using this set up mentioned above, the following step can be used to deploy the Lab Loader
Interface C3D Utility as a Web App.

1) The web form for the Lab Load Interface form will need to be copied to both the 
   application install direction as well as the application execution directory

	Copy the file:

	"LabLoadInter.htm" 

	to locations:

	D:\opapps45\html
	D:\ncioraapps\html

*Note: D:\opapps45\html is the location for the Oracle Clinical Launch pages.

2) The LLI form and its menu will need deployed to the C3D Application directory.

 	Copy the files:

	LLI.fmx
	LLI.fmb
	LLIMENU.mmx
	LLIMENU.mmb

	to:

	D:\ncioraapps

3) The LLI Web Form configuration definition will need added to the WebForm 
   Configuration File.

	Append the text using "cut and paste" from:
	
	Formsweb_cfg_LLI.TXT

	to the bottom of:

	D:\ORACLE\806\FORMS60\server\formsweb.cfg


	Copy the file "Formsweb_cfg_LLI.TXT" to D:\ncioraapps for safe keeping.

*Note: This assumes that the Oracle products were installed on the "D" drive in the root 
directory "ORACLE".


4) The Service "OracleiSuitesHTTPServer" will need to be restarted, to ensure that the
   LLI application is available.


5) Once completed, the URL should be similar to:

   http://middle_tier_name/opa45/LabLoadInter.htm

   *Note: middle_tier_name should be the same as that used by the URL for RDC or OPA.

6) Congratulations, you are DONE!
